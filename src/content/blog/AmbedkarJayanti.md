## Introduction

## A Life of a Social Reformer
Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891–1956) was a lawyer, economist, social reformer, and political leader. He played a key role in shaping modern India. Born into a Dalit family in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, he faced discrimination, which motivated him to fight against caste-based injustice.

Dr. Ambedkar excelled academically, studying at Columbia University and the London School of Economics. He worked for the rights of marginalized communities, criticized the caste system, and served as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution. He laid the groundwork for a democratic republic based on equality and freedom.

He also supported laws that protect civil rights, promote education, and ensure political representation for oppressed communities. Importantly, Dr. Ambedkar advocated for workers' rights, gender equality, and religious freedom. In 1956, shortly before he died, he embraced Buddhism, leading thousands of followers in a significant socio-religious movement in India.

## History of Ambedkar Jayanti
Ambedkar Jayanti has been observed on April 14th since the 1950s, shortly after Dr. Ambedkar’s death in 1956. It began with small tributes from supporters and Dalit organizations and grew into a nationwide observance recognized by the government of India.

In 1990, Dr. Ambedkar received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, further establishing him as a national icon. His birthday is now a public holiday in many states, serving as a day to reflect on social justice, equality, and nation-building.
