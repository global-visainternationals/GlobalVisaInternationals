## Comprehensive Eligibility Requirements

To successfully qualify for the Canada Start-up Visa, applicants must meticulously meet several key criteria:

### 1. Establishing a Qualifying Business

The cornerstone of your application lies in your proposed business venture and its structure within Canada:

- **Crucial Ownership Stakes**:
    - Each applicant within the same business venture must individually hold a minimum of 10% of the voting rights attached to all outstanding shares of the corporation at the time of incorporation. This ensures a genuine commitment and stake in the business's direction.
    - Collectively, the applicants and the designated organization providing the Letter of Support must hold more than 50% of the total voting rights in the corporation. This condition underscores the collaborative nature of the program, involving both the entrepreneur(s) and the supporting Canadian entity.

- **Mandatory Business Operations in Canada**:
    - The business must be legally incorporated within Canada to operate under Canadian law and contribute to the Canadian economy.
    - Active and continuous management of the business must be conducted from within Canada. This demonstrates a commitment to establishing a genuine presence and driving the business's growth within the Canadian ecosystem.
    - A significant and essential part of the business's core operations must take place within Canada, ensuring that the primary economic benefits are realized domestically.

### 2. Securing a Letter of Support from a Designated Organization: Your Key Endorsement

A critical component of the Start-up Visa application is obtaining a Letter of Support from a designated Canadian organization that has been approved by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to assess and invest in potential start-ups. These organizations fall into three categories:

- **Venture Capital Funds**: These funds provide financial investment and often offer strategic guidance to high-growth potential companies. A minimum investment of **CAD $200,000** is required from a designated venture capital fund. This investment signifies their confidence in your business's viability and potential for significant returns.
- **Angel Investor Groups**: Angel investors are high-net-worth individuals who invest their own capital in early-stage companies. A minimum investment of **CAD $75,000** is required from a designated angel investor group. Their investment often comes with valuable mentorship and industry connections.
- **Business Incubators**: These organizations provide support and resources to early-stage companies, such as office space, mentorship, networking opportunities, and business development services. Acceptance into a designated Canadian business incubator program is required, and **no direct financial investment is mandated** by the program through this route. However, incubators may have their own fees and requirements.

**Navigating the process of securing a Letter of Support can be complex. Global Visa Internationals has a proven track record of assisting entrepreneurs in connecting with designated organizations. Contact us to learn how we can help you!**

### 3. Demonstrating Language Proficiency: Essential for Integration

Effective communication is vital for business success and integration into Canadian society. You must demonstrate proficiency in either English or French at a Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) level of at least **5** in all four language abilities: reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

IRCC accepts results from the following designated language tests:

- **English**:
    - IELTS (International English Language Testing System) - General Training module: [www.ielts.org](https://www.ielts.org/)
    - CELPIP (Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program) - General test: [www.celpip.ca](https://www.celpip.ca/)

- **French**:
    - TEF Canada (Test d'évaluation de français pour le Canada): [www.lefrancaisdesaffaires.fr](https://www.lefrancaisdesaffaires.fr/en/test-for-canada/)
    - TCF Canada (Test de connaissance du français pour le Canada): [www.france-education-international.fr](https://www.france-education-international.fr/en/tcf-canada)

**Preparing for language tests can be challenging. Global Visa Internationals can provide resources and guidance to help you achieve the required CLB level. Reach out to us for support!**

### 4. Possessing Sufficient Settlement Funds: Ensuring a Smooth Transition

To ensure a successful settlement in Canada, you must demonstrate that you have enough unencumbered, transferable, and readily available funds to support yourself and your accompanying family members after your arrival. These funds should not be borrowed and must be in your name or jointly in the name of your accompanying spouse or common-law partner. The required amounts are updated annually by IRCC to reflect the cost of living in Canada.

**Settlement Funds Required (as of April 17, 2025):**



# Settlement Funds Required (as of April 17, 2025):

To support yourself and your family after arriving in Canada, you must have sufficient settlement funds. The amount required depends on the number of family members accompanying you:

- **1 person:** CAD $13,757
- **2 people:** CAD $17,127
- **3 people:** CAD $21,055
- **4 people:** CAD $25,690
- **5 people:** CAD $29,017
- **6 people:** CAD $32,700
- **7 or more people:** CAD $36,383

These funds must be readily available, transferable, and unencumbered. The requirements are updated periodically, so always check the [official IRCC website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/start-visa.html) for the latest figures.


**Understanding the financial requirements is crucial. Global Visa Internationals can help you determine the exact amount needed for your family size and ensure your funds meet IRCC criteria. Contact us for personalized advice!**

### 5. Expressing Intention to Reside Outside Quebec

It is important to note that the Start-up Visa Program is a federal immigration program. The province of Quebec has its own distinct immigration programs. Therefore, as an applicant under the federal Start-up Visa Program, you must declare your intention to reside in a province or territory other than Quebec.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Application Process

Navigating the Canada Start-up Visa application process requires careful attention to detail and adherence to IRCC guidelines. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the essential steps:

### Step 1: Developing a Compelling Business Idea

Your business idea is the foundation of your application. It should be innovative, possess strong potential for job creation within Canada, and demonstrate the capacity to compete effectively in the global market. Thorough market research, a robust business plan, and a clear understanding of your target audience are crucial at this stage.

### Step 2: Strategically Securing a Commitment from a Designated Organization

This is a pivotal step. You will need to identify and contact designated venture capital funds, angel investor groups, or business incubators whose investment or focus aligns with your business idea. Be prepared to present a compelling pitch deck and business plan. The designated organization will rigorously assess your venture's potential before deciding to issue a Letter of Support.

### Step 3: Undertaking an Approved Language Test

Schedule and complete an approved English or French language test well in advance of your application submission. Ensure you achieve the minimum CLB level of 5 in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Allow sufficient time for test preparation and for receiving your official results.

- **The crucial Letter of Support** from the designated organization, along with the commitment certificate.
- **Official proof of your language proficiency** from an approved testing center.
- **Documentary evidence of sufficient settlement funds**, such as bank statements.
- **A valid passport or other travel documents** for you and any accompanying family members.
- **Police certificates** from any country where you have lived for six months or more since the age of 18.
- **Results of your Immigration Medical Examination (IME)** conducted by a panel physician authorized by IRCC.

### Step 7: Submitting Your Complete Application

Once you have filled out all the forms, gathered all supporting documents, and paid the fees, carefully review your application one last time before submitting it electronically through the IRCC portal.

### Step 8: Providing Biometrics (if required)

## What Happens After You Submit Your Application?

### Acknowledgment of Receipt
Once your application is successfully submitted, you will receive an acknowledgment of receipt from IRCC, confirming that your application is being processed.

### Review of Your Application
IRCC will thoroughly review your application to ensure that it is complete and that you meet all the eligibility requirements for the Start-up Visa Program. This may involve multiple stages of assessment.

### Request for Additional Information
During the processing of your application, IRCC may request additional documents or information from you. It is crucial to respond promptly and accurately to any such requests.

### Immigration Medical Examination (IME)
If you haven't already completed your IME, IRCC will provide instructions on how to undergo the medical examination with a panel physician.

### Police Certificates
IRCC will verify the police certificates you have submitted and may conduct further background checks.

### Interview (Potentially)
In some cases, IRCC may require you to attend an interview to further assess your application and business proposal.

### Decision on Your Application
Once all assessments are complete, IRCC will make a decision on your application. You will be notified in writing of the outcome.

### Permanent Resident Visa and Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR)
If your application is approved, you will receive a permanent resident visa (if you are from a visa-required country) and a Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) document. The COPR is a crucial document you will need when you travel to Canada.

### Landing in Canada
Upon arrival in Canada, you will need to present your passport and COPR to a border services officer. This marks your official entry as a permanent resident of Canada.
