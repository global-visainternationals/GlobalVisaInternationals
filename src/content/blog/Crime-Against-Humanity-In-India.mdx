# **Pahalgam Terror Attack: Tragedy at Baisaran Meadow**



On April 22, 2025, the serene Baisaran Meadow near Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir became the site of a horrific terror attack. Militants affiliated with The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba, opened fire on a group of tourists, resulting in the deaths of at least 28 individuals and injuring over 20 others. This incident stands as one of the deadliest civilian attacks in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.

## **Details of the Attack**

The assault began around 2:50 PM when four to six assailants, dressed in military-style uniforms, approached the crowded meadow. Eyewitnesses reported that the attackers initially posed as policemen, requesting identification from tourists before suddenly opening fire. Survivors recounted that the militants targeted non-Muslim men, asking victims to recite the Kalma and checking for circumcision, sparing most women. One woman survivor shared that a terrorist told her, "Go tell this to Modi," after killing her husband.

## **Casualties and Victims**

The attack claimed the lives of 24 Indian tourists from various states, including Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh. Additionally, two local residents of Jammu and Kashmir and two foreign nationals from Nepal and the United Arab Emirates were among the deceased. Notably, Indian Navy Officer Lieutenant Vinay Narwal, aged 26, recently married on April 16, and Intelligence Bureau Section Officer Manish Ranjan from Hyderabad were also killed.

## **Claim of Responsibility**

The Resistance Front (TRF) claimed responsibility for the attack, citing opposition to the settlement of over 85,000 Indian "outsiders" in the Kashmir Valley, which they allege is altering the region's demographic composition.

## **Immediate Response**

Emergency services promptly arrived at the scene, transporting critically injured victims to Anantnag District Hospital and other nearby medical centers. Some individuals required air transport to a military hospital in Srinagar for extensive treatment.

In the aftermath, Indian security forces initiated a joint search and cordon operation in the vicinity, deploying helicopters to locate the attackers. A temporary lockdown was enforced in specific areas of Pahalgam.


## **National and International Reactions**

Prime Minister Narendra Modi cut short his visit to Saudi Arabia, condemning the attack and vowing that those responsible would be brought to justice. Union Home Minister Amit Shah traveled to Srinagar to assess the situation and coordinate the security response. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also curtailed her official visit to the United States and Peru.

Chief Minister Omar Abdullah described the incident as "much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years." President Droupadi Murmu expressed her condolences, labeling the act as "dastardly and inhuman." Opposition leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, condemned the attack, emphasizing support for the victims.

Internationally, countries and organizations such as the European Union and the United Nations issued statements condemning the attack and expressing condolences to the victims' families.

## **Ongoing Security Operations**

On April 23, security forces foiled an infiltration attempt along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla district, eliminating two terrorists in an ongoing operation near Uri. A large quantity of weapons, ammunition, and other war-like stores were recovered from the terrorists. Operations continue as authorities seek to apprehend any remaining perpetrators.
